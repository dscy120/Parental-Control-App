Notes:
This is a final year project completed during the academic year 2020/21.
To run this project, please use Android Studio to build the code and choose an emulator with API 24 or higher. (Recommended)

!!!Important!!!
Alternatively, an apk file (app-debug.apk) is provided for direct installation on a real Android device.
This application will override the navigation button of the device. If the parent user password is forgotten, a factory reset may be required to disable the parental control functions and uninstall the application. Or else user may be forced to use the phone under the parental control restrictions.
Therefore, it is recommended to test the application on a secondary device that is not your daily personal device. Data recovery is not guaranteed after factory reset.

Parent user default password: 1234
Please change the password in the "Parent Settings" module after login
